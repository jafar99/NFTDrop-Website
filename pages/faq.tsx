                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">NFT Stands for "Non-fungible token".“Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing.</p>

                        Step 2: Install MetaMask Wallet or Other Wallet

                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">You can add MetaMask to your browser by visiting Metamask.io. After adding it to your browser, you can follow the steps below to install your MetaMask wallet:
                        <br />
                    Step 1: Click on the ”create a wallet” button.
                        <br />
                    Step 2: Choose a strong password only you know. You will need this password to log into your MetaMask wallet.
                        <br />
                    Step 3: Metamask will provide a phrase that you can use as a security measure. You should write it down on a piece of paper or store in a USB flash drive. Don’t let anyone else know this secret phrase.
                        <br />
                    Step 4: Re-enter your phrase on Metamask and you will be all set.
                        <br />
                    If you remove MetaMask from your browser, you will use your backup phrase to restore your wallet. You can log in to your wallet just by entering the password that you created in the second step.

                    Now click the link to OpenSea while logged in your MetaMask wallet.</p>

                        Step 3: Fund your Metamask Wallet with Ethereum or other Cryptocurrency

                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Option 1: Buy ETH with Wyre <br />

                    You can buy Ethereum with a debit or credit card in a few minutes. However, the transaction may not always go through because there is a very high current demand. Click on the metamask chrome extension and then buy. Click continue to Wyre and enter how much Ethereum you want to buy. Just enter your credit card, and personal information and then submit. This is a pretty good option for beginners but it doesn’t always get approved.
                                <br /> <br />
                    Option 2: Buy Ethereum on Coinbase and send it to your wallet.
                        <br />
                     If option #1 doesn’t work, I would buy Ethereum from Coinbase. Coinbase is a secure platform that makes it easy to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more! It’s pretty simple to get started! Just create a coinbase account and fill out your information.

                    You will need to verify your information like email, address, date of birth, last 4 digits of social security, and what you want to use coinbase for. You will also need to add some sort of payment like a debit/credit card or login to your bank.</p>

                        Step 4: Find an NFT you want to buy!
                    </h3>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Log in to OpenSea to find a wide variety of NFTs! You can buy crypto collectibles or other NFT items like trading cards or metaverse land. Some NFTs are available for sale and some get sold to the highest bidder in an auction. <br /><br />

                    One of the most popular selling Crypto Collectibles is called the Crypto Punk. The Crypto Punk was the first NFT created and there were only 10,000 minted. One of the most lucrative ways to make a profit are from buying and reselling rare meme NFTs like this collection of Trump Memes. I highly doubt they are still for sale though because a lot of these are rare 1 of a kind digital pixelated NFTs. These are 34 Cryptopunks that one anonymous buyer bought for 557.5 ETH ($1,367,586.56 USD)
                    ! <br /> <br /> These crypto punks are valuable because of supply/demand & because they were the original NFT. Some NFTs are worth buying because of the quality of the art itself and the artist behind it. <br /><br />This image is called The Bull Run and people have paid upwards of $150K to own this digital asset. Part of the reason is because the artist Beeple is very famous and makes rare collectible artwork. <br /> <br />You can explore the full Beeple collection on OpenSeas but getting your hands on some of his artwork won’t be cheap! Be on the lookout for future Beeple drops because then you can make a serious profit of thousands or millions.
                    <br /> <br />After picking a crypto collectible, click on the buy button or place your bid. In order to bid you will need to convert your ETH to WETH. You will need to let OpenSea access your WETH for when a sale occurs. </p>
